Core Understanding

Why are labels preferred over Pod names or IPs for service discovery in Kubernetes?

What guarantees does Kubernetes provide—and not provide—around labels?

Can two different controllers manage the same Pod using labels? Why or why not?

What happens internally if a Pod’s labels no longer match its owning Deployment selector?

Why is .spec.selector in a Deployment considered immutable, and what breaks if you change it?

Services & Traffic Routing

How does a Service resolve its backend endpoints using selectors?

What happens to traffic when Pods matching a Service selector are deleted or recreated?

Can a Service select Pods across namespaces? Why?

What is the impact of adding version labels (e.g., version=v1) to a Service selector?

How would you design label selectors to support instant rollback?

Deployments & Rollouts

How do labels and selectors enable rolling updates?

What label strategy do you recommend for blue–green deployments?

How does Kubernetes prevent a Deployment from accidentally adopting Pods it did not create?

During a rolling update, how many different label sets can exist simultaneously?

Why is over-selecting labels in a Deployment dangerous?

Canary & Advanced Routing

Why can Kubernetes Services not natively support weighted traffic using selectors?

How do labels integrate with Ingress controllers for canary deployments?

What breaks if both v1 and v2 Pods match the same Service selector?

How would you isolate canary Pods without creating new namespaces?

When would you avoid using labels for versioning altogether?

Security & Network Policies

How do NetworkPolicies rely on labels and selectors?

What happens if labels are accidentally removed from Pods protected by a NetworkPolicy?

Can label misuse lead to a security breach? Give a scenario.

How do you design labels for zero-trust networking?

Why are IP-based firewall rules discouraged in Kubernetes?

Node Selection & Scheduling

What is the difference between nodeSelector, node affinity, and label selectors?

How do node labels influence scheduling decisions?

What happens if a node label changes while Pods are running?

How do labels help reduce infrastructure cost?

When would taints be preferred over label selectors?

Multi-Tenancy & Isolation

How would you design labels for multi-tenant workloads in a shared cluster?

Why is label-based isolation weaker than namespace isolation?

How do you prevent one tenant’s Service from selecting another tenant’s Pods?

How do labels interact with ResourceQuotas and LimitRanges?

How would you audit label usage in a large cluster?

Operations & Day-2 Scenarios

How do labels enable safe bulk operations?

What risks arise from inconsistent labeling across teams?

How do you enforce label standards across the organization?

What tooling would you use to detect label drift?

How do labels affect observability and alert routing?

Performance & Scale

How do selectors scale when a cluster has tens of thousands of Pods?

Are label lookups stored in etcd indexes? Why does this matter?

What is the performance impact of complex selector expressions?

Can excessive labels impact API server performance?

How would you design labels for a 50k-Pod cluster?

Failure & Debugging

A Service shows zero endpoints—how do you debug using labels?

A Deployment is stuck during rollout—how can selectors be the root cause?

How do you detect selector conflicts across controllers?

What kubectl commands help validate selector behavior?

How do you recover from a production outage caused by a bad selector?

Architecture Judgment

What is a “minimal selector” and why does it matter?

When is it acceptable to change labels on running Pods?

What label strategy would you standardize for microservices?

How do labels influence GitOps workflows?

What mistakes do junior engineers commonly make with labels and selectors?
