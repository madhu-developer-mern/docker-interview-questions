Core Understanding

Why are labels preferred over Pod names or IPs for service discovery in Kubernetes?

What guarantees does Kubernetes provide—and not provide—around labels?

Can two different controllers manage the same Pod using labels? Why or why not?

What happens internally if a Pod’s labels no longer match its owning Deployment selector?

Why is .spec.selector in a Deployment considered immutable, and what breaks if you change it?

Services & Traffic Routing

How does a Service resolve its backend endpoints using selectors?

What happens to traffic when Pods matching a Service selector are deleted or recreated?

Can a Service select Pods across namespaces? Why?

What is the impact of adding version labels (e.g., version=v1) to a Service selector?

How would you design label selectors to support instant rollback?

Deployments & Rollouts

How do labels and selectors enable rolling updates?

What label strategy do you recommend for blue–green deployments?

How does Kubernetes prevent a Deployment from accidentally adopting Pods it did not create?

During a rolling update, how many different label sets can exist simultaneously?

Why is over-selecting labels in a Deployment dangerous?

Canary & Advanced Routing

Why can Kubernetes Services not natively support weighted traffic using selectors?

How do labels integrate with Ingress controllers for canary deployments?

What breaks if both v1 and v2 Pods match the same Service selector?

What happens if a node label changes while Pods are running?

How do labels help reduce infrastructure cost?

When would taints be preferred over label selectors?

Multi-Tenancy & Isolation

How would you design labels for multi-tenant workloads in a shared cluster?

Performance & Scale

How do selectors scale when a cluster has tens of thousands of Pods?

Are label lookups stored in etcd indexes? Why does this matter?

What is the performance impact of complex selector expressions?

Can excessive labels impact API server performance?

How would you design labels for a 50k-Pod cluster?

Failure & Debugging

A Service shows zero endpoints—how do you debug using labels?

A Deployment is stuck during rollout—how can selectors be the root cause?

How do you detect selector conflicts across controllers?

What kubectl commands help validate selector behavior?

How do you recover from a production outage caused by a bad selector?

Architecture Judgment

What is a “minimal selector” and why does it matter?

When is it acceptable to change labels on running Pods?

What label strategy would you standardize for microservices?

How do labels influence GitOps workflows?

What mistakes do junior engineers commonly make with labels and selectors?
Core Concepts

What problem do namespaces solve that labels alone cannot?

Which Kubernetes resources are namespaced and which are cluster-scoped?

Why is the default namespace considered dangerous in production?

Can namespaces provide hard security isolation? Why or why not?

What actually happens inside the cluster when a namespace is deleted?

Architecture & Design

How do you decide between using namespaces versus separate clusters?

What are the trade-offs of environment-based vs team-based namespaces?

How would you design namespaces for a multi-tenant SaaS platform?

When does a namespace become too large to manage effectively?

How would you refactor a poorly designed namespace structure without downtime?

Networking & Traffic

How does Service discovery work across namespaces?

Why can a Service not directly select Pods from another namespace?

How do NetworkPolicies behave across namespace boundaries?

How would you allow traffic from frontend namespace to backend namespace securely?

What risks arise from unrestricted cross-namespace communication?

Security & RBAC

How is RBAC scoped using namespaces?

What is the difference between a Role and a ClusterRole?

Why are ClusterRoles often overused in organizations?

How would you restrict developers to deploy only within their namespace?

How do you prevent privilege escalation via namespace access?

Resource Management

How do ResourceQuotas work at the namespace level?

What happens when a namespace exceeds its CPU or memory quota?

How do LimitRanges differ from ResourceQuotas?

How would you protect production from noisy dev workloads?

What namespace-level controls help with cost optimization?

Operations & Day-2

How do namespaces reduce blast radius during failures?

How would you safely clean up unused namespaces?

What signals indicate a namespace is misconfigured?

How do you monitor resource usage per namespace?

How would you debug a Service that works in one namespace but not another?

GitOps & CI/CD

How do namespaces influence GitOps repository structure?

Should namespaces be created manually or via GitOps? Why?

How do you manage secrets across multiple namespaces?

What problems arise when CI pipelines share namespaces?

How do you promote workloads across namespaces safely?
